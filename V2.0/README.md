# Introduction

ERB V2 is a 3D printer multi-color control board based on RP2040, mainly used in Enraged Rabbit project. Based on V1, CANBUS connection is added, and the terminal connection method and layout are readjusted to better meet the needs of Enraged Rabbit V2.

## Features

- MCU RP2040 
- 28V Input Max，5V@3A
- USB & CANBUS interface
- 2 x TMC2209 Onboard
- 12 x IO for gate sensors/switch
- Onboard integrated heat sink
- 5V RGB，Servo supported
- Power supply/CAN integrated interface for easy connection

## Hardware

There are schemetic, silk and dwg file in `Hardware` folder.

## Firmware

### Compile options
On your klipper device (usually Raspberry Pi) run the following to create your make configuration:

```shell
cd  ~/klipper
make clean
make menuconfig
```

Select the following menuconfig settings

And create the firmware files by running the following:

```shell
make
```

### Firmware upload

#### 1.With your windows PC

Step 1: Connect 24V (Power on the board)

Step 2: Connect USB-C cable to your Klipper device (usually Raspberry Pi)

Step 3: Push and hold the BOOTSEL button

Step 4: Push the RST button and hold 0.5 seconds

Step 5: Release the RST button, after 3 seconds, Release the bootsel button

Step 6: `RPI-RP2` folder will show up on your computer, copy your built firmware `klipper.uf2` to the folder.

##### Connecting the board and bring it into flash mode

Step 1: Connect 24V (Power on the board)

Step 2: Connect USB-C cable to your Klipper device (usually Raspberry Pi)

Step 3: Push and hold the BOOTSEL button

Step 4: Push the RST button and hold 0.5 seconds

Step 5: Release the RST button, after 3 seconds, Release the bootsel button

Verify your device is in boot mode connected by running the following command:

```shell
lsusb
```

The output should contain an entry looking like 2e8a:0003 Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot

##### Flashing the firmware
Now we do not flash the fimware by directly copying it to the storage, but we flash it using the following command:

```shell
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003
```

The output looks like the following - IF you are prompted (you might or might not) for a password, enter the password of your current user account.

Now restart your fystec-erb by disconnecting 24V - waiting some seconds and reconnecting 24V again.
You should be able to see it as usual klipper device within 
```shell
ls /dev/serial/by-id
```

### Configuration

See `ercf_hardware.cfg` in this repository `config` folder.

### Known issues

The mark of GPIO24 and GPIO25 is swapped, check the silk file [here](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-ERB/blob/main/hardware/Silk%20Fixed.pdf).
